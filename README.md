# STag
This a method of classifying supernova by tagging spectral features as using these to make a prediction of the class using an artifical neural network. Both the tags and the class have an associated probability, which provides a measure of confidence in the classification given.

The provided notebook ('STag_Demonstartion.pynb') gives a description of how STag can be used by following the steps through with an example (also provided).
