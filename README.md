# STag
This a method of classifying supernova by tagging spectral features as using these to make a prediction of the class using an artifical neural network. Both the tags and the class have an associated probability, which provides a measure of confidence in the classification given.

The provided notebook ('STag_Demonstration.ipynb') gives a description of how STag can be used by following the steps through with an example (also provided).

# DASH
We make use of a number of functions from the software known as DASH (https://github.com/daniel-muthukrishna/astrodash) which are covered by their own license (https://github.com/daniel-muthukrishna/astrodash/blob/master/LICENCE). If you use the pre-processing functions in STag (which were taken from DASH) we ask that you also cite that paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02557
